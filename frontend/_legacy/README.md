# Legacy static frontend

This folder keeps the previous vanilla HTML prototype (login, dashboard, setup) after the migration to a Next.js + shadcn/ui app. These files are no longer used by the application but are retained for reference.

- `login.html`
- `dashboard.html`
- `setup.html`
- `config.js` (firebase sample)

You can open these files in a static server to view the old prototype.
